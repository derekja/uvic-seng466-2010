This is the first log entry.

I finished writing up the Eclipse Plug-in Setup guide. I came to the lab this Saturday and finished setting up the Eclipse environment for Riley. Also, I finished the framework of the sonar, it is not fully working yet but it should be this coming Tuesday.

One thing I noted while working today is that the file names must be CPP since this is a C++ project and the Arduino library uses C++ features. I had some mysterious build errors that I could not figure out why until I realized that my sonar source file was named sonar.c. All the problems disappeared after changing the name to sonar.cpp.
